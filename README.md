# word2vec2qna
This repo provides a set of QnA interviews and js assets that use text classification to select QnA interviews on the fly based on users' text input. Put another way, it's a framework for making a client-side chatbot that you can deploy on something like a GitHub page where only client-side scripting is allowed. 

Word Vectors and associated js, originally from https://github.com/turbomaze/word2vecjson
